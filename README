ResidenceSigns 2.0 Takes all the features from residencesigns made by KarnEdge. This project is coded from the scratch and not forked since KarnEdge didn't release the source back then.
Installing it is simple get the ResidenceSigns2.jar and put it in your plugins folder of bukkit it will then automatically create a config file and download the libraries it uses. It will require a server restart after starting it for the first time.
